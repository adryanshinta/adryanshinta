### I am Adryan

I've been fascinated with technology since I was a child. I enjoy testing out new software and hardware. It motivated me to understand more about how systems operate and finally introduced me to the modern technological era.

Since 2019, I've attempted to study and work part-time in a variety of agencies and organizations in my community. And now I work as a copywriter at Kampung KB Cemerlang in Perian Village.

Not only work, of course I also continue to learn. Some of the things that I continue to learn are English and Mandarin. Then some skills in programming such as Java, Python and MySQL databases.
